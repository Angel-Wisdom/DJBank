**A tiny banking demo / UI prototype** — built to practice front-end layouts and a minimal API mock.  
This project is intentionally simple and intended **only for learning and demo purposes**.

> ⚠️ **Important:** This is a mock/demo site. Do **not** use real credentials. The app stores test credentials in local storage and runs a tiny mock API for demonstration only.

---

## Demo
A static demo of the UI is available in the `docs/` folder (or at the hosted demo link if included in this repo).  
If you find the live demo, check the footer — there’s a small Easter egg related to the EchoTrace project.
